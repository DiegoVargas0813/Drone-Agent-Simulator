# Drone-Agent-Simulator
This is a python NoteBook that runs an agent-based simulation of a drone + camera based security system.

We have 3 cameras, 1 drone and 1 non-allowed personel instance in the simulation. The purpose of this simulation was to test the functionality of a computational vision AI model within a similated environment.

The drone will patrol around a perimeter until a camera or himself detects the unusual activity, said alarm only being raised if the non-allowed personel comes into the range of vision of any of the 3 cameras or drone. The simulation can also provide simple analytics of the success of our drone and cameras over the course of various executions.
