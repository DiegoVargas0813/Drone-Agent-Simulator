# Drone-Agent-Simulator
This is a python NoteBook that runs an agent-based simulation of a drone + camera based security system.

We have 3 cameras, 1 drone and 1 non-allowed personel instance in the simulation. The purpose of this simulation was to test the functionality of a computational vision AI model within a similated environment.
